# MarriageLab
MarriageLab is a plugin that brings marriage to Minecraft servers using commands. It has been tested on [Spigot](https://spigotmc.org) and [Paper](https://papermc.io).
## Requeriments
This plugin currently requires the following things:
- Spigot/Paper. Although the plugin may work using CraftBukkit, it is not recommended.
- Java 11 (required by the [mongo java driver](https://mongodb.github.io/mongo-java-driver/))
- A MongoDB database (if using the Mongo storage method)
## Installation
Download a pre-compiled version from the [releases page](https://github.com/Lably-Team/marriage-lab/releases) or compile the plugin yourself by cloning the repo and running `mvn clean package`. Then, drop it in your `plugins` folder and restart your Minecraft server.
